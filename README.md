# aiCounsel

This is a relationship advisor created for the Capstone Project, grade 12 computer science final project. It is called aiCounsel and uses streamlit for its web execution and ollama for its ai chatbot which advises the user. It is aimed to be as simple as possible, ux wise to allow for a clean look not requiring complex instructions which limits the appeal of an easy to use advisor like this. The ui visuals are meant to be clear to read but reasonably aesthetic, pink/red/white colours are used as those are associated with relationships (especially romantic ones). There is a username system so a specific user can be remembered as well as their chat log with the ai chatbot, and that data can be cleared if they wish. There are 4 specific relationship types, romantic, business, friendship and family, this is so the ai chatbot can be as specific as possible and prevent it getting confused. There are also disclaimers for the user, warning them of potential risks and things like that, and the code has guidelines forcing the ai chatbot to follow certain rules.
