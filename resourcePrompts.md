# Prompts

1. Give me code to add to my streamlit app to give me a pink-black gradient background, white text and a warm, cursive like but readable font for my headers.

2. Give me code to provide guidelines for my Ollama chatbot to prevent it from providing bad, dangerous or irrelevvant advice.

3. Give me code to save the users chathistory in a json memory file, based on the username they entered at the start.
